                <h2 id="splash">Splash Page</h2>
                    <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                        <p>The splash page (splash.html) is designed to create an engaging introduction to the website, 
                            "Life Below Ocean," before redirecting to the main content. It utilizes HTML for structure, 
                            CSS (splash_styles.css and global.css) for styling and animations, and a small amount of 
                            JavaScript (splash.js) to dynamically stagger the title animation. The page automatically 
                            redirects to the home page after a short delay using the <strong>&lt;meta&gt;</strong> tag 
                            with the `http-equiv="refresh"` attribute.</p>

                        <p>The key HTML elements include a <strong>&lt;div&gt;</strong> with the class 
                        `splash-container_info` which acts as the main container, centering the content both vertically 
                        and horizontally using flexbox. Inside this container, an <strong>&lt;img&gt;</strong>tag displays 
                        a background image (`SplashScreen.webp`).  The `alt` attribute provides alternative text for 
                        accessibility. An <strong>&lt;h1&gt;</strong> tag with nested <strong>&lt;span&gt;</strong> 
                        elements create the animated title, "LIFE BELOW WATER".  Each letter is wrapped in a <strong>
                        &lt;span&gt;</strong> to apply individual animations. A smaller <strong>&lt;h6&gt;</strong> 
                        provides a subtitle, and a <strong>&lt;p&gt;</strong>tag displays a mission statement.  Finally, 
                        a <strong>&lt;ul&gt;</strong> with <strong>&lt;li&gt;</strong> elements lists the team members.</p>

                        <p>CSS is crucial for the visual appeal. The `body` element is styled to remove default margins 
                            and set a fallback background color. The `splash-background` image is positioned absolutely 
                            and given a high `z-index` to appear behind the content. The core of the styling involves 
                            animations, which are created using CSS `@keyframes`. The `fadeInBackground` animation fades 
                            in the background image. The `revealLetter` animation makes each letter of the title appear 
                            with a slight slide-up effect. `fadeInSlideUpSubtitle` animates the subtitle. 
                            <br><br>
                            The mission statement uses `slideInFromLeft` to slide into view. The team member list uses 
                            `fadeInSlideUp` to make each name appear with a fade and slide-up effect. Flexbox is heavily 
                            used to control the layout and alignment of elements within the main container, ensuring 
                            responsiveness. Media queries are used to adjust font sizes and padding for different screen 
                            sizes, enhancing the user experience on mobile devices. Key CSS properties include `display: 
                            flex`, `justify-content`, `align-items`, `position: absolute/fixed/relative`, 
                            `z-index`, `opacity`, `transform`, `animation`, `font-size`, `text-shadow`, and 
                            `media queries`.</p>

                        <p>The JavaScript file (splash.js) dynamically sets the `animationDelay` property for each <strong>&lt;
                            span&gt;</strong> within the `splash-heading`, creating a staggered animation effect for the 
                            title. This is achieved using `document.querySelectorAll` to select all <strong>&lt;span&gt;
                            </strong> elements and then iterating over them using `forEach`. A random delay is calculated 
                            for each span, creating a unique visual effect.</p>

                        <p>The `noscript` tag provides alternative content if JavaScript is disabled, ensuring users can 
                            still navigate to the home page.</p>

                    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                        <p>Accessibility is addressed in several ways.  The `alt` attribute is used on the background 
                            image to provide descriptive text for screen readers. Semantic HTML tags like <strong>&lt;h1
                            &gt;</strong>, <strong>&lt;h6&gt;</strong>, <strong>&lt;p&gt;</strong>, and <strong>&lt;ul
                            &gt;</strong> are used to structure the content logically. The `lang` attribute is set to 
                            "en" on the <html> tag. The `noscript` tag provides a fallback mechanism for users who have 
                            JavaScript disabled, allowing them to navigate to the home page manually. The colors and 
                            fonts used provide sufficient contrast for readability. Furthermore, responsive design 
                            ensures that the page is usable across a variety of screen sizes and devices.</p>

                <h2 id="volunteer">Volunteer Page</h2>
                <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                <p>
                    This volunteer page utilizes HTML for structure and CSS for styling. The overall layout is created 
                    using semantic HTML5 elements like `section`, `<strong>&lt;h1&gt;</strong>`, `<strong>&lt;h2&gt;
                    </strong>`, `<strong>&lt;p&gt;</strong>`, and `<strong>&lt;a&gt;</strong>`.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The page is divided into three main sections: an introductory section, volunteer programs section, 
                    and a ratings/reviews section. The introductory section uses a background image set with CSS's 
                    `background-image`, `background-size`, and `background-position` properties.  A `button` element 
                    styled with custom CSS is used to link to the volunteer programs section, improving user navigation.  
                    The volunteer programs section showcases available programs in a horizontally scrolling slider.  
                    The slider is implemented using a `div` with `overflow: hidden` and CSS transformations applied to a 
                    child element containing the program cards to create the sliding effect.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The ratings/reviews section gathers user feedback via shark emoji selection and a text area for 
                    detailed reviews.  The shark emoji selection uses a grid layout (`display: grid`) for organization.  
                    The star ratings use buttons styled to look like stars.  Reviews are displayed using a horizontal 
                    scrolling container similar to the volunteer programs section.  `Flexbox` is used within the review 
                    cards and volunteer program cards for content alignment and responsive behavior.  Media queries are 
                    used to adjust layout and font sizes for different screen sizes, ensuring responsiveness.

                </p>
            
                <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                <p>
                    Accessibility considerations were integrated into the volunteer page's design and implementation. 
                    Semantic HTML tags like `<strong>&lt;section&gt;</strong>`, `<strong>&lt;article&gt;</strong>`, and 
                    appropriate heading levels (`<strong>&lt;h1&gt;</strong>`, `<strong>&lt;h2&gt;</strong>`, `<strong>&lt;
                    h3&gt;</strong>`) were used to provide a clear document structure for screen readers.  Descriptive 
                    `alt` attributes were added to all `img` tags to convey the image's content to users who cannot see 
                    them.  The "star" rating buttons have `aria-label` attributes specifying the number of stars, which 
                    screen readers can announce. The link in intro section has descriptive text. Color contrast was taken 
                    in to account to ensure the readbility of the text.

                <h2 id="content">Content Page</h2>
                <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                <p>This page, named "Life Below the Ocean - Content," aims to educate users about the impact of plastic 
                    pollution on our oceans. The page structure is built using semantic HTML5 tags for better 
                    organization and accessibility. The main content is divided into sections using headings (`strong>&lt;
                    h1&gt;</strong>`, `<strong>&lt;h2&gt;</strong>`) and paragraphs (`<strong>&lt;p&gt;</strong>`). The 
                    content is structured using a `<strong>&lt;div&gt;</strong>` with the class `content_container` to 
                    manage overall layout and spacing. Images are included using the `<strong>&lt;img&gt;</strong>` tag, 
                    with descriptive `alt` attributes for accessibility. A sidebar navigation menu, created using a `
                    <strong>&lt;div&gt;</strong>` with the class `sidenav-menu`, provides quick access to different 
                    sections of the page via anchor links (`<strong>&lt;a&gt;</strong>` tags). A "Go to Top" button 
                    allows easy navigation back to the beginning of the page. 
                    <br><br>
                    Key CSS properties are used for styling. 
                    The `flexbox` layout is used in the `.section_pollution` class to create a responsive, two-column 
                    layout where text and images alternate. Media queries are employed to adjust the layout for smaller 
                    screens, ensuring readability and usability on mobile devices. Animations, such as `fadeIn`, 
                    `fadeInUp`, `slideInLeft`, and `slideInRight`, are used to enhance the user experience by making the 
                    page more engaging and dynamic. The navigation bar and footer are dynamically loaded using 
                    JavaScript to maintain consistency across the website.</p>
            
                <p><strong>Key HTML Tags:</strong></p>

                    <li><strong>&lt;div&gt;</strong>: Used for creating containers for grouping elements and applying styles.</li>
                </ul>
            
                <p><strong>Key CSS Properties:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>font-family</strong>: Specifies the font for the text.</li>

                <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                <p>Accessibility was a key consideration during the implementation of this page. Semantic HTML5 tags were 
                    used to provide a clear document structure.  The `alt` attribute was included for all `<strong>&lt;img
                    &gt;</strong>` tags, providing descriptive text for screen readers. The sidebar navigation menu uses 
                    anchor links to allow users to jump directly to specific sections of the page. The "Go to Top" button 
                    provides an easy way to return to the top of the page, which can be especially helpful for users with 
                    mobility impairments.  Sufficient color contrast was maintained between text and background to ensure 
                    readability for users with visual impairments.</p>

                <h2 id="challenge">Challenges and Lessons Learned</h2>
                <p>
                    During the development of these web pages, we encountered several challenges that required collaborative problem-solving and adaptation. The primary hurdles involved:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Image Acquisition and Optimization:</b> Securing appropriate, high-quality images proved more time-consuming than initially anticipated. Finding images that accurately represented our content while remaining freely available for use (or acquiring the necessary licenses) required significant research and effort.  We primarily used Adobe Stock (or specify which Adobe service) for downloading images, but initial image downloads often resulted in overly large file sizes that negatively impacted page load speed.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Collaboration and Version Control:</b> Coordinating contributions from multiple team members, particularly with simultaneous code edits, required diligent use of version control (Git) and careful communication to avoid conflicts and ensure everyone was working with the latest versions.

                        <b>Image Optimization:</b> To address the image size issue, we implemented a multi-pronged approach.  We utilized CloudConvert to convert JPG and PNG images to the WebP format for improved compression and quality.  We also optimized images by resizing them to appropriate dimensions for their intended display size, and strategically compressed images using tools like TinyPNG and ImageOptim (or specify what you used if you used alternatives). The key lesson here was to prioritize image optimization from the outset of the project, rather than addressing it as an afterthought.

                        <b>Collaboration and Version Control:</b> We improved our Git workflow by establishing clear branching strategies and committing changes frequently with descriptive commit messages. Regular communication, using tools like Slack (or specify what you used), proved essential for coordinating changes and resolving merge conflicts promptly. We also started using pull requests to review each other's code before merging it into the main branch. This enhanced code quality and reduced the likelihood of introducing bugs. The main lesson here was the importance of clear communication and a well-defined Git workflow when working in a collaborative environment.  We also used Figma to collaborate on the design and prototyping of the web pages, which helped to ensure consistency and visual appeal.
