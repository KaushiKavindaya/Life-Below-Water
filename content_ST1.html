                        <p>Plastic pollution in oceans has become a serious environmental issue, affecting marine life
                            and ecosystems worldwide. Every year, millions of tons of plastic enter the ocean,
                            disrupting the food chain and harming marine biodiversity. From plastic bottles to
                            microplastics, the problem is widespread and requires immediate action.</p>

                    <div class="text">
                        <p>Plastic waste primarily originates from land-based sources, such as improper waste
                            disposal, littering, and industrial discharge. The major contributors include single-use
                            plastics, such as shopping bags, straws, and packaging materials. Rivers and wind carry
                            these plastics into the ocean, where they accumulate in vast patches like the Great Pacific
                            Garbage Patch.</p>

                    <div class="text">
                        <p>Many marine creatures ingest plastic debris, mistaking it for food. This leads to severe
                            health issues, starvation, and death. Sea turtles, for example, often eat plastic bags,
                            confusing them with jellyfish. Birds and fish also suffer from entanglement in plastic
                            waste, which restricts their movement and causes fatal injuries. Microplastics further pose
                            a threat by entering the food chain, ultimately affecting human health.</p>

                        <p>To combat plastic pollution, we must take collective action. Governments can implement
                            strict regulations on plastic production and usage, while businesses can adopt sustainable
                            packaging alternatives. Individuals can contribute by reducing plastic consumption,
                            recycling properly, and participating in beach cleanups. Advanced technologies, such as
                            ocean-cleaning drones, also offer innovative solutions to tackle this crisis.</p>
